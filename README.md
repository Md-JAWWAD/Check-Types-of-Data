A JavaScript program that takes an array containing elements of various types (such as strings, numbers, booleans, and nested arrays) and counts the total number of strings, numbers, and booleans in the entire array (including nested arrays).

let arr = ["2", 2, "a", 3, 6, true, false, [1, "2", [1, "a", "b", true, false], "a"], false, true];


Output example: 
Numbers: countOfNum
String: countOfStr
Bool:Â countOfBool.
